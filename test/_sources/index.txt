   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyMesaReader's documentation!
========================================
Here you will find some [limited] documentation of the three main classes in the mesa_reader module: ``MesaData``, ``MesaProfileIndex``, and ``MesaLogDir``. This documentation is automatically generated from docstrings in each class, so the appropriate documentation is always built in to whatever version of PyMesaReader you are using.
