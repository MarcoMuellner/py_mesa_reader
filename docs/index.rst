.. PyMesaReader documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyMesaReader's documentation!
========================================
Here you will find some [limited] documentation of the three main classes in
PyMesaReader: MesaData, MesaProfileIndex, and MesaLogDir. This documentation is 
automatically generated from docstrings in each class, so the appropriate
documentation is always built in to whatever version of PyMesaReader you are
using.

Contents:
